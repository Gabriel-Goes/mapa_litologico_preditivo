This file contains the summary of this project

# The Geologist Machine Repository contain all the steps necessary to create an environment for geological data analysis;

Starting from the construction of a local machine capable to execute commands through the interpretation of an logical language.

To do so, we'll need a personal computer and an operational system installed.

The local machine running this project is equiped with:

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 3600X (6 cores, 12 threads, 3,6 to 4,4Ghz )
- RAM: 1 Module of 16Gb at 3.2Ghz & 1 Module of 8Gb at 3.2Ghz
- GPU: Nvidia GTX 1650 Super ( 4Gb vram up to 2.1Ghz )
- DISK: 512Gb SSD ( w: 1800Mb/s; r: 3200Mb/s )

The current installed  OS is:

Manjaro Linux x86_64
Kernel: 5.14.10-1MANJARO 
shell: bash 5.1.8
