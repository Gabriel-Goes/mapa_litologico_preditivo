# THIS BRANCH IS INTENDED FOR PERSONAL ORGANIZATION AND FOR THOOSE WHO SEEK TO LEARN ABOUT SPATIAL DATA ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING

# HERE I'LL CREATE JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS TUTORIALS TO TEST PYTHON LIBRARIES AND BUILD WORKFLOWS TO IMPLEMENT INSIDE THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH

# Summary Description:

# The Geologist Machine Repository contain all the steps necessary to create an programming environment for geological data analysis;
# At the Tutorials branch we'll test our algorithms within google colabs environment, so it'll not be necessary to install any software
# into our local machine, and we can run all the codes with the google servers.

# One thing to be awere is the computer processing capabilities of our machines. By the output of verde.test() we could attest that my 
# local machine could execute computational operations faster and safer when compared to google colab server.
# But the google colab server could give us the possibility to start experimenting the code capabilities in a simple and easy manner;

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # 

# So let's head to google colab and lets start analyse our geospatial data through python codes;

 - At this point we are fully capable of creating workflow to process and analyse our geological data;

 - We gonna start by interacting with the online database of the Brasil's Geological Service and constructing a local database inside our machine.

 - The process of this interaction and local database creation is discretized within the first Tutorial Jupyter Notebook and can be read by typing the following command:
