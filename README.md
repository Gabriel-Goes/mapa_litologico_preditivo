# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS REPOSITORY, ANY CONTENT INSIDE IT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGES, IF YOU SPOT ANY ERROR REPORT BY OPENING AN ISSUE

# THIS BRANCH IS INTENDED FOR PERSONAL ORGANIZATION AND FOR THOOSE WHO SEEK TO LEARN ABOUT SPATIAL DATA ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING

# HERE I'LL CREATE JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS TUTORIALS TO TEST PYTHON LIBRARIES AND BUILD WORKFLOWS TO IMPLEMENT INSIDE THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH

# IF YOU SEEK TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROJECT *HEAD TO DEVELOPMENT BRANCH BY TYPING:

	git branch development

# This file contains a Summary list and Summanry Description

# Summary List:
- 1 Programming Environment - Google Colabs;
	Google Colabs is a online service that provide computational power via internet;

- 2 Programming Language
	- Python
		Tutorials 
			- Jupyter Notebooks:
  				1: GeoPandas Reading loose shp & Writing Data Base.gpkg;
					1.1: GeoPandas - Filtering and Visualizing Spatial Data;
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Summary Description:

# The Geologist Machine Repository contain all the steps necessary to create an programming environment for geological data analysis;
# At the Tutorials branch we'll test our algorithms within google colabs environment, so it'll not be necessary to install any software
# into our local machine, and we can run all the codes with the google servers.

# One thing to be awere is the computer processing capabilities of our machines. By the output of verde.test() we could attest that my 
# local machine could execute computational operations faster and safer when compared to google colab server.
# But the google colab server could give us the possibility to start experimenting the code capabilities in a simple and easy manner.
# So could be easy to anybody jump'n and learn the basics of computer algorithms and geospatial data analysis.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # 

# So let's head to google colab and lets start analyse our geospatial data through python codes;
	
	I've created a folder, and i'm sharing it by this link:
		

 - At this point we are fully capable of creating workflow to process and analyse our geological data;

 - We gonna start by interacting with the online database of the Brasil's Geological Service and constructing a local database inside our machine.

 - The process of this interaction and local database creation is discretized within the first Tutorial Jupyter Notebook and can be read by typing the following command:

	jupyter-notebook 1-Geopandas:Geopackage_as_Database.ipynb
